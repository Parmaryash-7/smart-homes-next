              <strong>Note:</strong> With the introduction of the Real Estate
              (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, and the rules and
              regulations notified thereunder ("RERA") on 1 May 2017, we are
              still in the process of updating our website(s) and contents of
              each page and project(s) to ensure full compliance with the law.

              over 920 sq kms and one of the Largest Greenfield Industrial
              Cities to be developed under DMIC (Delhi Mumbai Industrial
              Corridor) is being conceptualized and designed to be developed
              from completely barren land into a Smart City. Each and every real
              estate project of Dholera Greenfield region may come under purview
              of RERA act, however; Dholera Greenfield region being developed
              from a barren land with zero or almost no resources available,
              certain areas are yet to be notified under the said act. As an
              investor, one should know/be aware that investment in Dholera
              Greenfield region is completely for the investment purposes at the
              present moment. One can think Dholera Greenfield region as a wise
              choice for futuristic investment because the way Government is
              planning to develop Dholera Greenfield region, investments made
              will surely attract good multiples.
